# *dawgif*

Dawgif is a **Flask-based** web application that dynamically serves a random dog GIF. The app is **containerized with Docker**, deployed on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, and managed through **Terraform**. The **CI/CD pipeline** is automated using **GitHub Actions**, and the container images are stored in **Google Artifact Registry**

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Flow  

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, building, and deployment. Below is the step-by-step flow of the CI/CD pipeline:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Push & CI/CD Trigger  
- A push to the `main` branch or a pull request triggers the pipeline.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Checkout Repository  
- The workflow pulls the latest code from the repository.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Terraform  
- Downloads and installs **Terraform** for infrastructure management.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Python Environment  
- Installs Python and dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Tests  
- Executes unit tests to ensure the application is working correctly.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Authenticate with Google Cloud  
- Uses a **service account key** to log in to Google Cloud and set the correct project.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Install GKE Auth Plugin & kubectl  
- Installs tools required to interact with **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Get GKE Cluster Credentials  
- Retrieves Kubernetes credentials to deploy the application.  

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize & Apply Terraform  
- Provisions the GKE cluster using **Terraform**.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Version Tag  
- Creates a **new version tag** based on the number of commits in the repository.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Build & Push Docker Image  
- **Builds a Docker image** and pushes it to **Google Artifact Registry (GAR)**.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy to Kubernetes  
- Updates the Kubernetes deployment with the new image and **restarts pods** to apply changes.
